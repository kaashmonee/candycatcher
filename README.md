# CandyCatcher
Term project for 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science offered at Carnegie Mellon University. Catch candy flying candy with your mouth!

## Installation (Linux only)
Please follow this guide to install OpenCV and a virtual environment. 

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/10/24/ubuntu-16-04-how-to-install-opencv/

Using a virtual environment is highly recommended.

## Usage (For VSCode only)
Please do not activate virtual environment before running `code .`. Activate virtual environment by running `$ workon cv` in the integrated terminal after opening Code.

### Miscellaneous
There was a bug that said the camera was busy...restarting fixed it, but watch out for it.

### Acknowledgements
Huge thanks to Adrian Rosebrock from www.pyimagesearch.com. His tutorials were very useful in getting acquainted with OpenCV.
